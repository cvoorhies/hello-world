# hello-world
My beginning to learning about how to use a repositories as I grow my soft skills. 
About me? I'm one of those if you see me I look like I'm not approachable, but after you meet me you'll see I'm a nice guy. My youngest daughter says I would be a horible math teacher. I guess I have high expectations from people. "say what you mean, and mean what you say."
